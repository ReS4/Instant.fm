::: Instant.fm :::

The idea is to make it very easy to upload, create, and share music playlists using YouTube music videos as the source of the audio.


::: Instant.fm Features :::

Playlist Creation
- No login required
- Build your playlist on site
- Or, upload a .m3u, .txt, or .pls file from iTunes, Windows Media Player, or WinAmp
- Each playlist gets a unique, shareable, short URL
- Background image uploading

Playlist Editing
- Drag and drop to re-order songs
- Buttons to Move song to top & Remove song
- Change playlist name/title with an inline edit (no refresh)

Playlist Viewing
- Shuffle, repeat, show/hide video
- Suggest songs to be added to playlist (TODO)
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users

Social Features
- Share playlist on Facebook, Twitter
- Share current song on Facebook, Twitter (TODO song permalinks)

Mini-browser
- Pane which behaves like an iOS navigation view, with a stack of 'views'
- Allows searching and browsing artist/album information without stopping the music
- Clicking links doesn't cause user's browser to leave the page
- Uses fancy animations, which look great

Non-stop Music
- On top music sites, clicking something may stop the music (it's not consistent).
- On Instant.fm, everything is AJAX, so nothing stops the music.
- Even logging in/out works without a page refresh (the correct playlist edit tools are shown/hidden).


::: How We Built It :::

HTML5 Boilerplate (rock-solid default for HTML5 websites)
- Build script for minifying and hyper-optimizing JS, CSS, and HTML.
- CSS reset, base styles, cross-browser normalization, non-semantic helper classes.
- Server side optimization to reduce total page weight.

CSS3
- 1660 lines of hand-written CSS.
- CSS3 hotness (transitions, box-shadow, border-radius, gradient, box-reflect, text-shadow)
- Degrades gracefully in older browsers


::: JavaScript Libraries :::

jQuery 1.5
- The best

jQuery UI 1.8
- We use sortable / draggable.

Modernizr
- HTML5 feature detection in JS and CSS.
- HTML5 shiv so semantic elements like <header> work in IE.

YepNope
- Conditional JS resource loader for polyfills
- Asynchronous script loading


::: Backend :::

Python
